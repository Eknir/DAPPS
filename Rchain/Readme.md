These contracts could be used as a communication channel for the BlockHeight at which Rchain will define the balances
for the Genesis block. 

Solidity contracts reside in the folder contracts. Rchain and Genesis are new, Ownable and Pausable are Open Zeppelin 
standards. Please refer to https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/zeppelin-solidity/tree/master/contracts

Unit tests for the contracts Rchain and Genesis reside in the folder tests.

For unit tests for the contract Pausable and Ownable, please refer to 
https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/zeppelin-solidity/tree/master/test

To run the unit tests, and/or deploy the contracts, please download Truffle (http://truffleframework.com/)
